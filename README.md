# Team-Profile-Generator

## Goal:
The goal of this assignment was to show the student's knowledge of object-oriented programming by building an application that uses inquirer to prompt the user for employee information that will be written to an html file that is generated through node.
## How:
Inquirer is used to build prompts for the user of the application to fill out; the user will provide manager information, engineer information, and intern information. This information is stored and written to an html file that is generated through node. Tests are ran through jest to show that the code works as intended.

## Result:
The application is able to prompt the user for employee information when invoked. It successfully stores the given information and writes it to an html file. The built webpage displays the employee information in a series of organized cards.
